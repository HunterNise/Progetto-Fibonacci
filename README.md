# Progetto-Fibonacci

[Progetto Fibonacci](https://www.progettofibonacci.it/) is an initiative that aims to translate and make accessible the work _Liber Abaci_ by Leonardo Pisano (Fibonacci).

Building on the previous one, this project aims to collect some of the most significant algorithms exposed in the work and rewrite them in the C language.
