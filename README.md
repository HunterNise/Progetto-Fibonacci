# Progetto-Fibonacci

[Progetto Fibonacci](https://www.progettofibonacci.it/) is an initiative that aims to translate and make accessible the work _Liber Abaci_ by Leonardo Pisano (Fibonacci).

Building on the previous one, the goal of this project is to collect some of the most significant algorithms exposed in the work and rewrite them in the C language.

The following code needs to be downloaded, compiled (a C compiler is necessary) and executed on your machine.

It is also available a [repl](https://replit.com/@HunterNise/Progetto-Fibonacci?v=1) that does not require to download anything: just follow the instructions in the readme to execute the desired program directly on the browser.

The repository consist of: a library (_mylib.h_) that contains all the general purpose functions and the custom structures needed; the various programs, splitted according to the chapter they appear in the _Liber_; a report (_relazione.pdf_) on the project (in italian).
