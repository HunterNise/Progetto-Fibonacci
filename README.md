# Progetto-Fibonacci

[Progetto Fibonacci](https://www.progettofibonacci.it/) is an initiative that aims to translate and make accessible the work _Liber Abaci_ by Leonardo Pisano (Fibonacci).

Building on the previous one, this project aims to collect some of the most significant algorithms exposed in the work and rewrite them in the C language. <br>

<br />

The code here needs to be donwloaded, compiled (a C compiler is necessary) and executed on your own machine.

It is also available a [repl](https://replit.com/@HunterNise/Progetto-Fibonacci?v=1) that does not need to download anything: just follow the instruction in the readme to execute the desired program directly on the browser.
